# A description of how we obtained the datasets and how they can be accessed.

## Secondary data

We conducted a large-scale scoping analysis/literature review to understand the available datasets on mental health and how common these mental health conditions are across African settings. We used relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria to search for the studies, and used a developed standard operating procedure to request for datasets from the research corresponding authors.

The scoping analysis led to access of datasets from 17 articles. Source Code can be found here: [APHRC-DSE/INSPIRE-Mental-Health-Project_Landscape_Analysis](https://github.com/APHRC-DSE/INSPIRE-Mental-Health-Project_Landscape_Analysis)
