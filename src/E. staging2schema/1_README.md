### staging2schema.org
 
**staging2schema.org** is a toolset designed to generate [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) `Dataset` descriptions directly from Mental Health(MH) staging database. The goal is to make metadata and data hosted in the staging server **machine-readable**, **FAIR-compliant**.  

This work is inspired by and builds upon the principles of data standardization and harmonization discussed in the paper:  
*Mugotitsa, B., Amadi, D. K., et al. (2024). Integrating longitudinal mental health data into a staging database: harnessing DDI-lifecycle and OMOP vocabularies within the INSPIRE Network Datahub. Frontiers in Big Data, 7.*

#### Learning Path

Follow this sequence to navigate the materials effectively:

1. **📝 Quick Overview – `guide_checklist.md`**  
   - One-page checklist of essential Schema.org properties.

2. **📖 Full Guide – `guide_full.md`**  
   - Detailed explanations for each property, context, and recommended additions.

3. **⚙️ Metadata Extraction – `Translation.md`**  
   - Scripts to extract metadata and related data from the staging database, including variable definitions, labels, and controlled vocabularies.

4. **💻 JSON-LD Conversion – `jsonld.md`**  
   - Converts extracted metadata into **Schema.org JSON-LD scripts**, producing machine-readable representations of the datasets.

5. **🔎 Understanding JSON-LD Graphs – `about_schema.org_json-ld.md`**  
   - Explains how Schema.org vocabulary defines a **graph of entities and relationships**.  
   - Illustrates nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) in JSON-LD and how datasets become interlinked graphs, enabling richer machine-readable metadata.

####  💡 Tips

- Start with **checklist** to understand key properties.  
- Use **full guide** to deepen knowledge of each property.  
- Explore **metadata extraction** and **JSON-LD conversion scripts** to see practical implementation.  
- Review **JSON-LD graph concepts** to understand how entities and relationships are represented for machine-readability.
