"Longitudinal Path Analysis For The Directional Association Of Depression, Anxiety And Posttraumatic Stress Disorder With Their Comorbidities And Associated Factors Among Postpartum Women In Northwest Ethiopia: A Cross-Lagged Autoregressive Modelling Study      ","This study aimed to assess the prevalence and longitudinal associations of postnatal comorbid and multimorbid anxiety, depression, and PTSD among postpartum women in Ethiopia",Ethiopia,"Introduction
Vulnerability for depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms due to perceived traumatic birth increase during the postpartum period. Traumatic birth has been defined as an event occurring during labour and birth that may be a serious threat to the life and safety of the mother and/or child. However, the comorbidity and multimorbidity of depression, anxiety and PTSD with their direct and indirect predictors is not well investigated in the postpartum period. In addition, the longitudinal directional association of depression, anxiety and PTSD with their comorbidities is not studied in Ethiopia.

Objective
The aim of this study was to assess prevalence of postnatal comorbid and multimorbid anxiety, depression and PTSD. It also aimed to determine the directional association of postnatal anxiety, depression and PTSD with the comorbidity and multimorbidity of these mental health problems over time and to explore the factors that are directly or indirectly associated with comorbidity and multimorbidity of anxiety, depression and PTSD.

Methods
A total of 775 women were included at the first, second and third follow-up of the study (6th, 12th and 18th week of postpartum period) during October, 2020 –March, 2021. A cross-lagged autoregressive path analysis was carried out using Stata 16.0 software in order to determine the autoregressive and cross-lagged effects of depression, anxiety and PTSD with their comorbidities. In addition, a linear structural equation modelling was also carried out to determine the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on the comorbidities of depression, anxiety and PTSD.

Results
Comorbidity of anxiety with depression was the most common (14.5%, 12.1% and 8.1%) at the 6th, 12th and 18th week of postnatal period respectively. With regard to the direction of association, comorbidity of PTSD (due to perceived traumatic birth) with depression, PTSD with anxiety, depression with anxiety and triple comorbidity predicted depression and anxiety in subsequent waves of measurement. Direct and indirect maternal morbidity, fear of childbirth and perceived traumatic childbirth were found to have a direct and indirect positive association with comorbidities of depression, anxiety and PTSD. In contrast, higher parity, higher family size and higher social support had a direct and indirect negative association with these mental health disorders.

Conclusion
Postnatal mental health screening, early diagnosis and treatment of maternal morbidities, developing encouraging strategies for social support and providing adequate information about birth procedures and response to mothers’ needs during childbirth are essential to avert comorbidity of anxiety, depression and PTSD in the postpartum period.",Postpartum Women,"Postnatal comorbid and multimorbid anxiety, depression and PTSD.","Socio-demographics (age, educational status, marital status, religion, ethnicity, occu-

Longitudinal Mediation Analysis Of The Factors Associated With Trajectories Of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Among Postpartum Women In Northwest Ethiopia: Application Of The Karlson-Holm-Breen (Khb) Method,"This study investigated trajectories of PTSD symptoms among postpartum women in Northwest Ethiopia, revealing four distinct trajectories and identifying depression, anxiety, fear of childbirth, and perceived traumatic childbirth as significant risk factors",Ethiopia,"Introduction
In recent years, literatures identified childbirth as a potentially traumatic experience resulting in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with 19.7 to 45.5% of women perceiving their childbirth as traumatic. A substantial variation in PTSD symptoms has been also indicated among women who experience a traumatic childbirth. However, there has been no research that has systematically investigated these patterns and their underlying determinants in postpartum women in Ethiopia.

Objective
The aim of this study was to investigate the trajectories of PTSD symptoms and mediating relationships of variables associated with it among postpartum women in Northwest Ethiopia.

Methods
A total of 775 women were recruited after childbirth and were followed at the 6th, 12th and 18th week of postpartum period during October, 2020 –March, 2021. A group-based trajectory modeling and mediation analysis using KHB method were carried out using Stata version 16 software in order to determine the trajectories of PTSD symptoms and mediation percentage of each mediator on the trajectories of PTSD symptoms.

Results
Four distinct trajectories of postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were identified. Perceived traumatic childbirth, fear of childbirth, depression, anxiety, psychological violence, higher WHODAS 2.0 total score, multigravidity, stressful life events of health risk, relational problems and income instability were found to be predictors of PTSD with recovery and chronic PTSD trajectory group membership. Depression and anxiety not only were strongly related to trajectories of PTSD symptoms directly but also mediated much of the effect of the other factors on trajectories of PTSD symptoms. In contrast, multiparity and higher mental quality of life scores were protective of belonging to the PTSD with recovery and chronic PTSD trajectory group membership.

Conclusion
Women with symptoms of depression, anxiety, fear of childbirth and perceived traumatic childbirth were at increased risk of belonging to recovered and chronic PTSD trajectories. Postnatal screening and treatment of depression and anxiety may contribute to decrease PTSD symptoms of women in the postpartum period. Providing adequate information about birth procedures and response to mothers’ needs during childbirth and training of health care providers to be mindful of factors that contribute to negative appraisals of childbirth are essential to reduce fear of childbirth and traumatic childbirth so as to prevent PTSD symptoms in the postpartum period.",Postpartum Women,Trajectories of PTSD symptoms and mediating relationships of variables associated with it,"Socio-demographics (age, educational status, marital status, religion, ethnicity, occu-

"Demographic, psychosocial and clinical factors associated with postpartum depression in Kenyan women","This is a study on the prevalence and risk factors of postpartum depression in Kenyan women, highlighting the significance of addressing partner conflict resolution as part of maternal healthcare interventions",Kenya,"Background
Few longitudinal studies have examined associations between risk factors during pregnancy and mental health outcomes during the postpartum period. We used a cohort study design to estimate the prevalence, incidence and correlates of significant postpartum depressive symptoms in Kenyan women.
Methods
We recruited adult women residing in an urban, resource-poor setting and attending maternal and child health clinics in two public hospitals in Nairobi, Kenya. A translated Kiswahili Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale was used to screen for depressive symptoms at baseline assessment in the 3rd trimester and follow up assessment at 6–10 weeks postpartum. Information was collected on potential demographic, psychosocial and clinical risk variables. Potential risk factors for postpartum depression were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Results
Out of the 171 women who were followed up at 6–10 weeks postpartum, 18.7% (95% CI: 13.3–25.5) were found to have postpartum depression using an EPDS cut off of 10. In multivariate analyses, the odds of having postpartum depression was increased more than seven-fold in the presence of conflict with partner (OR = 7.52, 95% CI: 2.65–23.13). The association between antepartum and postpartum depression was quite strong but did not reach statistical significance (OR = 3.37, 95% CI: 0.98–11.64).
Conclusions
The high prevalence of significant postnatal depressive symptoms among Kenyan women underscores the need for addressing this public health burden. Depression screening and psychosocial support interventions that address partner conflict resolution should be offered as part of maternal health care.",Antepartum women attending a health care clinic,Postpartum depression,"Demographics(age, marital status,education level,religion,income)

Proximity To Healthcare Clinic And Depression Risk In South Africa: Geospatial Evidence From A Nationally Representative Longitudinal Study,"This study investigates the association between distance to primary healthcare clinics (PHCCs) and depression risk in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa,",South Africa,"Proximity to primary healthcare facilities may be a serious barrier to accessing mental health services in resource-limited settings. In this study, we examined whether the distance to the primary healthcare clinic (PHCC) was associated with risk of depression in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Depressive symptoms and household coordinates data were accessed from the nationally representative South African National Income Dynamics Study. Distances between households and their nearest PHCCs were calculated and mixed-effects logistic regression models fitted to the data. Participants residing <6 km from a PHCC (aOR = 0.608, 95% CI 0.42-0.87) or 6-14.9 km (aOR = 0. 612, 95% CI 0.44-0.86) had a lower depression risk compared to those residing ≥15 km from the nearest PHCC. Distance to the PHCC was independently associated with increased depression risk, even after controlling for key socioeconomic determinants.

Approximately 89.6-91.8% identified themselves as religiously affiliated, while 88.0-90.3% perceived religion to be important in South Africa during the observed study periods. A short-term association between religious involvement and significant depressive symptomatology was not detected, but logistic regression models that accounted for the clustering of repeated observations within participants indicated that, over time, those with religious affiliations (aOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.96) were at a lower risk than those not affiliated. Furthermore, individuals who reported religious activity as being important (aOR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73-0.91) were at less risk of significant depressive symptomatology over time than those rating religious activity as not important.

The Relationship Between Negative Household Events And Depressive Symptoms: Evidence From South African Longitudinal Data,"This study investigates the relationship between negative household events and vulnerability to depression among South African adults from 2008 to 2012, revealing significant associations between serious illness or death of household members and adult depressive symptoms, underscoring the need for support services for both directly affected individuals and their families.",South Africa,"Background
The relationship between negative life events and vulnerability to depression is not well-documented in developing countries, particularly using large-scale, longitudinal data. This study seeks to add to this literature by examining the relationship between negative household events and vulnerability to depression amongst a representative sample of South African adults for the period 2008–2012.

Methods
Data from three waves of the longitudinal South African National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) were analysed to estimate the association between negative household events and adult depressive symptoms using ordinary least squares (OLS) and fixed-effects regression models.

Results
One in four South Africans reported that they lived in a household where at least one household member had been seriously ill or injured, or where a household member, relative or friend had died within the previous two years. There was a significant association between the serious illness of a household member, or the death of a family member who provided financial assistance, and adult depression scores.

Limitations
The study used data collected in a large-scale household survey by field work teams. It is reliant on self-reported depressive symptoms that have not been validated by formal clinical diagnosis.

Conclusions
There are high rates of morbidity and mortality in South Africa, and adults living in households where family members are ill or have died are significantly more vulnerable to depression. These findings highlight the importance of providing counselling and psychiatric support not only to those directly affected by negative health events, but also to their family or household members.",Adults in South Africa,Negative household events and Depressive symptoms,"Sociodemographic and economic ( gender, age, population group(race), union status(marital or cohabit), education, employment status, geographical location, living conditions index)",,,25/04/2017,,,South Africa,6,,10.1016/j.jad.2017.04.031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2017.04.031,The Relationship Between Negative Household Events And Depressive Symptoms: Evidence From South African Longitudinal Data,Journal of affective disorders,45882691,Negative household events; depressive symptoms; longitudinal data; South Africa,4073743,,,South Africa SALDRU
Living Alone And Depression In A Developing Country Context: Longitudinal Evidence From South Africa,"This study explores the mental health implications of living alone among adults in South Africa, utilizing national longitudinal data from the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS",South Africa,"In South Africa, single-person households were a household type enforced by apartheid legislation, designed to restrict the ""influx"" of Africans into ""white"" and typically urban areas of the country. Yet the increase in living alone has been one of the most marked demographic trends of the post-apartheid period. The trend, which has occurred alongside the persistence in individual labor migration patterns and a decline in rates of union formation, has been driven by changes among working-age adults, rather than among older adults. This is the first empirical study to investigate the mental health implications of living alone among all adults in South Africa using national longitudinal data. The data come from five waves of the panel household survey, the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS), conducted from 2008 to 2017. Information on depressive symptoms was collected from all adults (15 years and older), who were asked the ten questions which make up the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CES-D 10). Adults who lived alone reported significantly higher depression scores than other adults, in the pooled ordinary least squares models, and in the fixed effects model, which controlled for any unobservable, time-invariant differences between the two groups of adults. Vulnerability to depression was moderated by adults' preferences to continue living in their area of residence (as a measure of their social integration), but the positive relationship remained sizeable and significant across all models. The findings shed light on a further dimension of the migrant labor system in South Africa, which has not received adequate attention in the empirical literature, viz. the mental health implications for adults of solo migration, and they provide further motivation for the provision of affordable and safe family housing in local areas of employment.",Adults who live alone,Depression scores,"Sociodemographic: quadratic age, gender (female); population group (African, Colored ,Indian , white), marital status (currently married), Years of education; Employment status (employed);  Residence(urban formal area, urban informal area, rural formal area, rural tribal area), Economic status)

Simultaneous Social Causation And Social Drift: Longitudinal Analysis Of Depression And Poverty In South Africa,"The study investigates the reciprocal relationship between depression and poverty in South Africa, highlighting the simultaneous effects of social causation and social drift theories, emphasizing the need for multi-sectoral policies addressing both economic determinants of depression and evidence-based treatment to mitigate its economic impact.",South Africa,"Background
Two theories have been proposed to explain the observed association between depression and poverty, namely social causation and social drift. Little is known regarding the relative importance of social causation and social drift in low and middle-income countries, where poverty is more severe and where most of the world's depressed individuals live.

Methods
We analysed nationally representative longitudinal data from the National Income Dynamics Study in South Africa and simultaneously tested social causation and social drift hypotheses using structural equation modelling across three waves.

Results
Worse individual economic status at time 1 and 2 was independently associated with worse depression two years later at time 2 (standardised linear regression coefficient ? = ?0.110, Standard Error (SE): 0.024) and four years later at time 3 (? = ?0.113, SE: 0.025) respectively. Conversely worse depression at time 1 and time 2 was independently associated with worse economic status at time 2 (? = ?0.037, SE: 0.016) and time 3 (? = ?0.028, SE: 0.012) respectively. In addition, the ""effect"" of depression on future assets was stronger among people with less baseline assets.

Limitations
The time span between data rounds is relatively short (four years); response rates are unequal across ethnic, age and sex groups; and the measure of depression is based on self-report.

Conclusions
Social causation and social drift act simultaneously in this population, reinforcing poverty/depression cycles. Multi-sectoral policies are required that both prevent depression by addressing its economic determinants, and provide evidence-based treatment to mitigate the economic impact of depression.",Individuals who were 15 years or older,Poverty and depression cycles,"Sociodemographic variables (Education,Race, Residence,Household monthly income, Employment status)",,,15/03/2018,,,South Africa,7,,10.1016/j.jad.2017.12.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2017.12.050,Simultaneous Social Causation And Social Drift: Longitudinal Analysis Of Depression And Poverty In South Africa,Journal of affective disorders,45882691,"Depression, Poverty, Social causation, Social drift, Low and middle-income countries, South Africa",4073743,,,South Africa SALDRU

Cross-sectional data from the &ldquo;Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH community in South Africa&rdquo; (HAALSI) baseline survey were analysed. Socio-demographic, clinical, health, and sleep duration data were collected. The total sample included 4725 persons 40 years and older (mean age 61.5 years, SD = 13.0, age range of 40⁻111 years) in one sub-district in rural South Africa. The mean sleep duration was 8.28 ± 1.93 h. Short (<7 h) and long (&ge;9 h) sleepers accounted for 13.1% and 40.0% of the sample, respectively. In adjusted multinomial logistic regression, greater wealth status ( < 0.05), inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption ( < 0.001), and depressive symptoms ( < 0.05) were associated with a higher odds and physical inactivity ( < 0.05) with a lower odds of short sleep duration.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate longitudinal associations with incident and persistent intrusive pain among rural South Africans.
Methods
Longitudinal data from two consecutive waves in 2014/2015 and 2018/2019 in Agincourt, South Africa, were analysed. Pain was assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory.

Results
In all, 683 adults of 3,628 participants without intrusive pain in Wave 1 (19.1%) had incident intrusive pain in Wave 2, 94 adults of 254 participants who had intrusive pain in Wave 1 (38.3%) had intrusive pain at both Wave 1 and 2 (persistent intrusive pain). Furthermore, 358 (7.2%) participants had intrusive pain at baseline. In the fully adjusted model for people without intrusive pain at baseline, the study found that obesity (AOR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.05–1.63), depressive symptoms (AOR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.34–2.08), PTSD (AOR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.19–2.45), and poor sleep quality (AOR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.04–1.62) were positively associated with incident intrusive pain. Older age was positively, and male sex and daily alcohol use were negatively associated with incident intrusive pain. Furthermore, in the final adjusted logistic regression model, this study found that older age was positively, and underweight, overweight, and high sedentary behavior were negatively associated with persistent intrusive pain.
